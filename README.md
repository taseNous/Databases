1.  In Pylon ERP, reports can be designed using SQL queries to extract, filter, and present data directly from the systemâ€™s relational database. The platform provides a flexible reporting tool that allows users to build custom reports by writing SQL statements, enabling the combination of data from multiple tables such as sales documents, inventory, customers, and financial transactions. SQL-based reports in Pylon can incorporate nested SELECTs, calculated fields, conditional logic, and aggregations to deliver precise business insights tailored to the company's needs. Additionally, the system allows parameters to be used in reports (@UserParts), offering dynamic filtering by user input, such as date ranges, customer codes, or product categories. This capability makes SQL a powerful tool for creating advanced, real-time reporting within Pylon, beyond the standard built-in report templates.
