1.  In Pylon ERP, reports can be designed using SQL queries to extract, filter, and present data directly from the system’s relational database. The platform provides a flexible reporting tool that allows users to build custom reports by writing SQL statements, enabling the combination of data from multiple tables such as sales documents, inventory, customers, and financial transactions. SQL-based reports in Pylon can incorporate nested SELECTs, calculated fields, conditional logic, and aggregations to deliver precise business insights tailored to the company's needs. Additionally, the system allows parameters to be used in reports (@$UserParts$), offering dynamic filtering by user input, such as date ranges, customer codes, or product categories. This capability makes SQL a powerful tool for creating advanced, real-time reporting within Pylon, beyond the standard built-in report templates.

3.  The University project is a Database Management System project titled Employee Evaluation System. It covers the complete design and implementation of a relational database for managing employee evaluations in a company. The project begins with an ER diagram and its relational schema, then progresses to SQL implementation, where 20 tables are created, such as user, company, evaluation, and job_position. The implementation includes SQL CREATE and INSERT statements, usage of stored procedures for operations like fetching employee evaluations and computing final scores, and triggers to enforce rules and log changes. The system includes safeguards—for example, preventing unauthorized updates to sensitive fields and allowing only the administrator to modify user profiles.
